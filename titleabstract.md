### Quantum tori associated with sequences and their applications

The quantum cluster algebra is introduced by Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky to provide an algebraic-combinatorial
framework for investigating the basis of quantum groups. By the celebrated quantum Laurent phenomena, it is a $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$-subalgebra
of quantum tori associated with each quantum seed.  In this series of talks, we consider the quantum tori associated with sequences of
indices of quantum groups. These quantum tori are deeply related with the root system and (monoidal) categorifications via quiver Hecke algebras.

In the first and second talks, we explore the construction of these quantum tori and their associated applications by focusing on "reduced" sequences.
In the third talk, we broaden our scope by removing the constraints of reducedness, discussing recent developments associated with such sequences.

### Quantum cluster mutations and 3D integrablity
The tetrahedron equation was proposed by Zamolodchikov in 1980, and the 3D reflection equation was 
proposed by Isaev and Kulish in 1997, to describe the integrability of 3D lattice models. 
In this talk I introduce new solutions to these equations by using quantum cluster mutations, 
based on joint works with Atsuo Kuniba, Xiaoyue Sun, Yuji Terashima and Junya Yagi.
We develop the method introduced by Sun and Yagi [arXiv:2211.10702], where they attach three types of quivers 
to wiring diagrams, and for each of them the quantum mutations yield the solution of the tetrahedron equation 
in terms of quantum dilogarithm functions. 
Our strategy is to embed the noncommuting algebra generated by quantum y-variables in the q-Weyl algebra 
associated with wiring diagrams. We construct adjoint operators R and K that realize 
Yang-Baxter transformation and reflection transformation respectively.

### Generalized Markov number and generalized cluster algebra
The Markov equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$, studied in the theory of Diophantine approximation by Andrei Markov around 1880, is known to have all positive integer solutions obtained through the operation of mutation in a certain cluster algebra, starting from the trivial solution $(1,1,1)$. In 2023, a generalization of the Markov equation, denoted as $x^2+y^2+z^2+k(yz+zx+xy)=(3+3k)xyz$, which can similarly yield all positive integer solutions through the mutation operation in a certain (generalized) cluster algebra, was discovered by myself and Matsushita. In this presentation, I will introduce recent results about this extension. This presentation includes the contents of joint works with Kodai Matsushita, and with Shuhei Maruyama.

### Cluster structures on $q$-Painlevé systems via toric geometry
I will review a geometric interpretation of cluster varieties in terms of blowups of toric varieties discovered by Gross, Hacking, and Keel. I will show that this provides the cluster theoretic interpretation for the geometry of $q$-Painlevé systems studied by Sakai, when the rank (in the sense of linear algebras) of an exchange matrix is two.

### Strong duality data of type $A$ and extended $T$-systems
A strong duality datum is a family of finite-dimensional simple modules over a quantum affine algebra $U_q'(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. One important property is that we can associate from it the quantum Schur--Weyl duality functor preserving simple modules.
Extended $T$-systems, introduced by Mukhin--Young, are short exact sequences satisfied by the tensor product of finite-dimensional simple $U_q'(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$-modules
in types $A$ and $B$ (called snake modules), which contains the celebrated $T$-systems. In this talk, motivated by the generalization of $T$-systems given by Kashiwara--Kim--Oh--Park, we give a generalization of extended $T$-systems for a general strong duality datum of type $A$, which coincides with the Mukhin--Young's extended $T$-systems when we take a strong duality datum consisting of fundamental modules.
