# Title and Abstract

## Yasuaki Gyoda (Tokyo)
### Generalized Markov number and generalized cluster algebra
The Markov equation $x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz$, studied in the theory of Diophantine approximation by Andrei Markov around 1880, is known to have all positive integer solutions obtained through the operation of mutation in a certain cluster algebra, starting from the trivial solution $(1,1,1)$. In 2023, a generalization of the Markov equation, denoted as $x^2+y^2+z^2+k(yz+zx+xy)=(3+3k)xyz$, which can similarly yield all positive integer solutions through the mutation operation in a certain (generalized) cluster algebra, was discovered by myself and Matsushita. In this presentation, I will introduce recent results about this extension. This presentation includes the contents of joint works with Kodai Matsushita, and with Shuhei Maruyama.

### Cluster structures on $q$-Painlevé systems via toric geometry
I will review a geometric interpretation of cluster varieties in terms of blowups of toric varieties discovered by Gross, Hacking, and Keel. I will show that this provides the cluster theoretic interpretation for the geometry of $q$-Painlevé systems studied by Sakai, when the rank (in the sense of linear algebras) of an exchange matrix is two.
