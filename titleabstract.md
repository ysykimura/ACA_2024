# Title and Abstract

## Yuma Mizuno (Chiba)
### Cluster structures on $q$-Painlevé systems via toric geometry
I will review a geometric interpretation of cluster varieties in terms of blowups of toric varieties discovered by Gross, Hacking, and Keel. I will show that this provides the cluster theoretic interpretation for the geometry of $q$-Painlevé systems studied by Sakai, when the rank (in the sense of linear algebras) of an exchange matrix is two.
